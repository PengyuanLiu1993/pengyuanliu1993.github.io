Hi there! I'm Pengyuan Liu, currently serving as a Lecturer (Assistant Prof.) in Digital Planning, School of Social & Political Sciences, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom. My expertise lies in the field of quantitative urban geography, where I specialised in GeoAI and urban digital twin research. I hold a PhD in Geography from the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. Before joining the University of Glasgow, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher and Coordinator at Future Cities Laboratory, Singapore-ETH Centre. In 2023, I contributed as a Lecturer (Assistant Prof.) in Human Geography and Urban Planning at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China. My journey also includes valuable postdoctoral research experiences at the NUS Urban Analytics Lab and the University of Helsinki.

I am deeply passionate about integrating geospatial analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital twins within urban studies. My work focuses on developing theories, algorithms, and models that advance this integration. Additionally, I am an advocate for the open data initiative in academia, demonstrated by my role in organizing international academic conferences for OpenStreetMap, including the 2022 State of the Map (Academic Track) and 2023 OSMScience. My aim is to foster innovation in urban studies through cutting-edge research and collaboration, contributing to the development of smarter, more sustainable urban environments.
